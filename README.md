Dimaagi_Keeeda
==============

A number adding game similar to 2048(in terms of addition property )

In it numbers do not move like in 1024 or in 2048..rather they give ILLUSION of appearing from one box to another.

The  Timer is a Fantastic Thing which is beyond than basic Clocks or numbers..it is a cart moving on screen when it 

gets collide with screen edge(called Screen Walls), YOU ARE OUT!

2 levels in terms of Difficulty, 3 types of numbers, 3 background appearances(themes), 2 types of addition.

Language is for FUN ONLY!!
